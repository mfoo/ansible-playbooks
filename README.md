This repository is a test repository for learning Ansible.

TODO: If I like Ansible and everything's working fine, delete the above and replace it with the

This repository contains ansible playbooks to manage bootstrapping and maintenance of machines.
Apart from my office machine, personal desktop, a few servers and laptops, I regularly launch
virtual machines and containers. The playbooks here help me manage configuration and infrastructure
across all of those machines.
